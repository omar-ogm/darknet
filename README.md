**This is a fork of the original Darket Project. To make use of YOLO detection network for custom problems.

### Project Structure
- **cfg**: Contains the graph of the YOLOv3 and YOLOV3-tiny 

- **data**: Contains the configuration files to be use by darket.exe to train the network

- **dataset**: The BCCD dataset in VOC format and with labels ready to be use by the YOLO network. NOTE: In order to use darknet to train the network the labels must be within the same directory as the images.
